/*
Mock project status data for Hack Tahoe TRPA Project Tracker prototype

A 'project' consists of an array of 'state' objects.
'state' object has properties:
    status: string - project status
    message: string - brief explanation of project status
    contact: object
    alert: object - optional, for mocking project that needs applicant action
   
'contact' object properties:
    name: string
    dept: string
    email: string
    phone: string
};

'alert' object properties:
    message: string
    todo: string
